# Human Rights Education Notes

## What is Human Rights Education?

**Definition**: Human rights education (HRE) is a field of education that delves into the principles, values and applications of human rights in everyday life.
    - It's about understanding how human rights impact us all, from our personal interactions to global issues.
    - HRE isn't just about knowledge – it's also about **action**.
    - HRE forms the backbone of a movement towards a more just and equitable society. 
    - A collaborative effort involving governments, international organizations, and civil society to foster understanding and respect for human rights.

**Overal Goal**: To promote a culture of human rights through education.

**Goal**: It aims to question and challenge attitudes and behaviors from a human rights approach, which enables learners to foster a global mindset that champions human dignity and justice, regardless of borders or boundaries.

**Objectives**: Ensuring access to education and integrating human rights into educational content.

### The Global Framework
Article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) calls for education of human rights

International instruments like the Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training underscore the importance of education in empowering individuals to exercise their rights and uphold the rights of others.

### Why do we need human rights education?
HRE shapes our mindset and culture towards acceptance and respect for everyone's rights.

Through HRE, individuals gain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to exercise their rights and advocate for others.

- HRE fosters global solidarity, recognizing our shared humanity and common challenges.
- HRE contributes to peaceful and inclusive societies built on values of equality, justice and respect.
- HRE empowers individuals to recognize and challenge injustices and violations of their rights and those of others.

### Where does human rights education occur?
HRE thrives in diverse settings, be it formal classrooms or informal gatherings. Every educational environment offers valuable opportunities to educate others and foster a global culture of human rights.

- Formal Education
    - Structured educational institutions, including primary and secondary schools and universities, and vocational and technical training for professional groups.
- Informal Education
    - Learning experiences that happen naturally in everyday life, often outside of structured institutions or programmes. It doesn't typically involve a structured curriculum, formal assessments, or certification. 
- Non-Formal Education
    - Planned programmes and processes of personal and social education for people designed to improve a range of skills and competences, outside the formal educational curriculum.

### Key components of human rights education
- **Advocacy**: Trying to change a law or policy to be more human rights friendly 
- **Protesting**: Organizing, attending or supporting a protest
- **Self-Improvement**: Reflecting on your own actions and attitudes to align them more with human rights values
- **Signing a petition**: For a human rights cause or campaign you care about
- **Doing research**: Learning about critical human rights issues around the world
- **Speaking about human rights**: Promoting human rights values with those around you whether through a conversation with a friend or a post on social media

Three essential requirements:
1. **About** Human Rights: HRE involves educating others about human rights, what mechanisms are used to protect them, and how they relate to our lives.
2. **For** Human Rights: HRE involves promoting attitudes, values and behaviours that support and uphold human rights. It emphasizes fostering empathy, respect, tolerance and a commitment to social justice. HRE programmes aim to cultivate a culture of human rights within individuals and communities, encouraging them to actively promote and defend human rights in their daily lives.
3. **Through** Human Rights: HRE emphasizes the use of human rights principles and methodologies in the process of education itself. It involves applying human rights values and approaches to teaching and learning practices, making education itself a human rights experience. HRE uses participatory and inclusive teaching methods that empower learners and promote critical thinking, dialogue and active engagement with human rights issues.

### Traditional vs Participatory Facilitation
In HRE, we aim to use **participatory methodologies as much as possible**. Through learning by doing, learners have the opportunity not only to know about their rights, but also to exercise them.

Traditional education approaches involve the educator transferring knowledge to those being educated. This places the focus on education ABOUT human rights and is teacher-centred. 

Participatory education approaches, on the other hand, involve greater interaction between the educator and participants. Participatory approaches position the educator as a catalyst for learners to embark on processes of reflection, analysis and critical thinking that lead to transformation. This gives equal value to education ABOUT, FOR and THROUGH human rights and is learner-centred.
    - Participatory approaches achieve greater flexibility and focus on the personal development of learners as opposed to a more traditional and conventional educational process.

## Facilitating Human Rights Education

### The Role of a HRE Facilitator/Educator
Facilitation involves using **participatory methods** to encourage active participation and foster a conducive atmosphere for learning. Facilitators play a central role in guiding discussions, promoting reflection and empowering participants to take ownership of their learning journey.

Facilitators promote **co-responsibility for learning** among the group, ensuring that everyone has a voice in determining the topics to be covered.

Facilitators must recognize that some groups have historically been (more) excluded and should strive to make the space equitable for everyone. This might require, for example, adjusting facilitation techniques to ensure that all voices are heard, actively challenging biases, and creating opportunities for underrepresented participants to lead discussions.

Safeguard participants to cultivate a positive, healthy learning environment by:
- **Preparation**
It is important to have a plan! Think of your role as a facilitator as someone who sets a direction for your time together, but lets the participants inform and guide where exactly that time will go. You will need to go with the flow of the group without losing sight of the planned objectives of the activity and the steps that have to be followed to achieve these. Importantly, the facilitator does not have all the answers and should be open and clear about that from the outset. This acknowledgment fosters a collaborative environment where everyone feels encouraged to contribute and learn. The facilitator is not “the person in charge,” nor do they have sole control of the agenda. Participants should have a voice in determining the topics to be covered. The facilitator’s role is to ensure that learning happens more effectively.

- **Developing Self-Awareness**
Developing self-awareness is crucial for facilitators as they hold a position of power and privilege in learning environments, which can influence discussions. Regular self-reflection for both facilitators and participants is key to recognizing and addressing our biases and assumptions, and their impact on group dynamics. Encouraging participants to reflect on their own biases and perspectives can help to foster open-minded discussions and helps create a safe, positive learning environment.

- **Setting The Tone**
It is important to set the right tone for the group from the start by establishing an inclusive learning environment where all perspectives are valued and respected. One way to establish an inclusive learning environment is to start by collaboratively setting ground rules for respectful communication and active listening. Discuss the desired learning environment with participants, emphasizing mutual respect and understanding, ensuring no one feels obligated to share things they aren't comfortable with. Acknowledge diverse experiences and potential tensions, fostering an atmosphere of openness and support. Encourage participants to express themselves using "I" statements and refrain from personal attacks. For example, saying "I feel that.." rather than "You do..." or "People always...".


- **Facilitating Challenging Discussions**
As a facilitator, you play a central role in guiding discussions, ensuring they remain focused, respectful and balanced. Prepare participants for diverse opinions and be ready to intervene if needed, promoting productive exchanges and addressing misconceptions constructively. It’s important to acknowledge and value differing perspectives while maintaining the dignity and integrity of the group. Remind participants of ground rules to navigate challenging moments effectively. Encourage active listening and use trigger warnings where appropriate, giving participants the option to take a break if needed. Offer regular scheduled breaks to allow participants to recharge and process their emotions. 

- **Facilitating with Well-Being in Mind**
As facilitators, we have a 'duty of care' towards our learners who engage in our learning processes. Prioritizing well-being is paramount for both facilitators and participants. Talking and hearing about human rights abuses can be traumatic and cause emotional distress, even if someone isn't directly involved. This is called 'vicarious trauma'. To help participants cope with their emotions encourage self-care, offer moments for reflection, and ensure participants have access to strong support systems and psychological help if needed.

### Exploring Examples of Good Practice
There are many ways you can equip others with the skills and knowledge they need through HRE. You could identify training opportunities for your peers or colleagues, support your local teachers by providing resources or workshops on human rights topics, or organize interactive learning events such as debates, film discussions, workshops or other activities for local youth or other community members. Your actions make a difference.

### How do you make HRE a participatory process?
Remember that you will want to strike a balance between being able to discuss difficult topics, but also inspire participants. Remember to have fun! Creativity and fun go a long way in creating engaging activities and learning spaces. If participants enjoy themselves or feel active and inspired, this will enhance learning.

[ ] Learning begins with the experience and knowledge of the participants and is learner-centred. The participants take ownership and direct their learning process, deciding together, through discussions and agreements, what they want to learn and why. 

[ ] Participants share and critically analyze their own experiences, identifying commonalities and patterns to contextualize their learning, (that is, apply it to their own realities). 

[ ] New information is introduced from different sources. These can be testimonials, stories, films, historical narratives, published media or other sources that help to deepen analysis, inspire the creation of new ideas and rethink existing knowledge.  

[ ] Questions play a fundamental role in fostering critical thinking. In participatory processes, it is key to have open questions that facilitate dialogue and reflection.

[ ] Participants apply what they've learned, practicing skills and developing strategies to address injustices and obstacles to their rights.

**Ways to Deliver Learning**

There are many different methodologies, modalities, and pedagogical models through which you can employ action-oriented approaches that can be incorporated into formal, non-formal and informal educational spaces.
- **Experiential Learning**: “Learning by doing” - Engaging learners in hands-on, real-life activities that deepen their understanding of human rights concepts and how to apply them in real-life situations.
- **Workshop**: A facilitated and structured session of discussion and activity with a particular education aim or focus.
- **Learning through Play**: Supports participants, child and adult alike, to make sense of the world around them through play activities.
- **E-learning**: Learning through different online formats such as self-paced courses, webinars and facilitated workshops and meetings.
- **Blended Learning**: A style of education in which students learn via electronic and online media as well as face-to-face teaching.
- **Training of Trainers**: Equips people to deliver human rights education within their own communities and/or professions.
- **Bitesize Learning**: Education content broken into small, highly focused chunks that are manageable for learners to complete.
- **Audio Visual Aids**: The use of audio and video media to share educational content, often used in addition to facilitated learning and group discussion.
- **Collaborative Learning**: An approach that promotes democratic and collective learning, where everyone can contribute and learn together, decentralizing power and generating consensus. 

**Participatory Tools** 

In order to prepare a learner-centred lesson, you need to facilitate activities that engage learners and enable them to participate in their learning journey. There are many different tools that can be used as the building blocks for learner-centred participatory education. Below are some examples:
- **Group Work**: A small number of learners working together to share ideas, experiences or do activities.
- **Case Studies**: An in-depth example of one person, group or event that learners can relate to/understand.
- **Role Play Activity**: Learners explore and express situations and responses through acting.
- **Community Mapping Activity**: Supports learners to contextualize a topic and its impact on people and communities.
- **Participatory Theatre**: A live performance where learners interact with performers or presenters.
- **Co-operative Games**: An activity where learners work together to solve a problem or succeed as a team.

### Overcoming Challenges and Caring for your Well-Being
Discussions on human rights topics can often be emotionally taxing for both facilitators and learners.

- **Team Up!**: When you facilitate activities, there are many processes happening simultaneously. You have prepared your activity that you want to guide people through, but group dynamics and conversations might take you in a different direction and require adjustment of what you had prepared. You want to follow your programme, but listen with attention too. At the same time, you are keeping time and organizing other logistical issues, such as dividing people in teams for group work, handing out workshop materials, or addressing technical issues for your presentation. This is why it can be beneficial to facilitate with at least two people, so you can divide the workload and help each other out. 
- **Set Realistic Boundaries**: Recognize that your work can be emotionally demanding. Set clear and realistic boundaries for your time and emotional energy. Understand that you may not be able to solve every problem or address every issue, and that's okay.
- **Practice Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. Understand that human rights work often involves confronting challenging and emotionally charged issues. Acknowledge your efforts, celebrate your successes, and be compassionate with yourself during difficult moments. You do not have to be perfect and you are not expected to have all the answers. Acknowledge when you might not know something, and ask other participants what they think or propose.
- **Cultivate a Supportive Community**: Having a network to share experiences, seek advice, and provide emotional support can be invaluable in maintaining mental well-being. You can empower learners to research and connect with relevant human rights groups so that they can maintain motivation long after your intervention. Or you could support them to create their own human rights community. Community groups often have different, sometimes overlapping, purposes.
