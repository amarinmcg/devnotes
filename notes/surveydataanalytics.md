# Survey Data Analytics

### Main purposes of Surveys
- **Collect**: Gather data on attitudes, experiences, and opinions from users, clients, citizens, and employees regarding government services and programs.
- **Inform**: Help inform core functions of public administration, guiding decision-making and policy development. All core functions of public adminstrations: POSD CoRB
- **Measure**: Assess government performance by collecting feedback from stakeholders, both objectively and subjectively.
- **Engage**: Solicit public feedback, gather ideas, establish priorities, and improve trust in government.

These purposes help ensure that government services are effective and aligned with the needs of the community.

### Surveys and Core Functions
**O**rganizing: Surveying families regarding child ages and intentions for school enrollment
**P**lanning: Surveying citizens for ideas for and responses to government initiatives
**D**irecting: Client satisfaction/feedback surveys
**S**taffing: SUrveys of public sector employees
**Cross-Cutting**:
    - Public opinion surveys
    - Survey data to augment the Census
    - Research surveys funded by government

### Where Do Survey Data Come From?
- Government collects its own data through surveys
- Government uses data collected through an external survey
- Government funds independent survey research (to be made public)

### Main Types of Surveys Used In Government
- **Public Opinion Surveys**: These gather general opinions from citizens on various issues, policies, or government performance. They help gauge public sentiment and inform decision-making.
- **Client Satisfaction Surveys**: These focus on the experiences of individuals who have used government services, assessing their satisfaction and identifying areas for improvement.
- **Census Surveys**: Conducted periodically, these surveys collect demographic data from the entire population, providing essential information for planning and resource allocation.
- **Specialized Surveys**: These are designed for specific purposes, such as health surveys, education assessments, or economic studies, to gather detailed information on particular topics.
- **Employee Surveys**: These assess job satisfaction, engagement, and feedback from public sector employees, helping improve workplace conditions and policies.

### Role of Surveys in Measuring Government
Surveys play a crucial role in measuring government performance in the following ways:

- **Gathering Feedback**: Surveys collect opinions from citizens and stakeholders about their experiences with government services. This feedback helps identify areas of success and areas needing improvement.
- **Assessing Satisfaction**: By asking questions about satisfaction with services, surveys provide insights into how well the government is meeting the needs of the public.
- **Identifying Issues**: Surveys can reveal specific problems or challenges faced by citizens, allowing governments to address these issues proactively.
- **Tracking Changes Over Time**: Regular surveys can track changes in public opinion and satisfaction over time, helping governments understand the impact of their policies and initiatives.

### Purpose of Public Opinion Surveys
- **Understanding Public Sentiment**: They help gauge how citizens feel about specific issues, policies, or government actions, providing insights into public attitudes.
- **Informing Policy Decisions**: By collecting data on public preferences, these surveys guide policymakers in making informed decisions that reflect the needs and desires of the community.
- **Identifying Trends**: Public opinion surveys track changes in attitudes over time, helping governments understand shifting priorities and concerns among citizens.
- **Enhancing Accountability**: They provide a mechanism for citizens to express their views, holding government officials accountable for their actions and decisions.

**Example**: A government might conduct a public opinion survey to **assess support for a new policy initiative**, allowing them to adjust their approach based on citizen feedback.

### Survesy Administered by 3rd Party
1. Survey Interviews
    - Structured and Semi-Structured
    - One-on-One (In-Person/Telephone)
    - Group Interviews

### Purpose of the Survey
To collect information from a group of people about their opinions, experiences, or behaviors. 

Here are some key reasons why surveys are conducted:
- **Gather Data**: Surveys help gather quantitative and qualitative data on specific topics, which can be analyzed to understand trends or patterns.
- **Understand Opinions**: They allow organizations to understand what people think about a product, service, or policy, helping to make informed decisions.
- **Measure Satisfaction**: Surveys can assess customer or employee satisfaction, providing insights into areas that may need improvement.
- **Identify Needs**: They help identify the needs and preferences of a target audience, which can guide future actions or developments.
- **Evaluate Programs**: Surveys can evaluate the effectiveness of programs or initiatives, helping organizations understand their impact.

### Survey Design
Key components of survey design include:
1. **Purpose of the Survey**: Clearly define what you want to learn from the survey.
2. **Target Audience**: Identify who you want to survey (e.g., specific demographics or groups).
3. **Sampling Frame**: Determine how you will select participants from the target audience (e.g., random sampling, convenience sampling).
4. **Survey Type**: Decide on the type of survey (e.g., self-administered, interviewer-administered, online, paper-based).
5. **Question Design**: Create clear and concise questions that are easy to understand. Use a mix of question types (e.g., multiple choice, open-ended).
6. **Data Collection Method**: Choose how you will collect responses (e.g., online platform, phone interviews, in-person).
7. **Pilot Testing**: Conduct a small test of the survey to identify any issues with questions or format before the full launch.
8. **Response Rate Strategy**: Plan how to encourage participants to respond (e.g., reminders, incentives).
9. **Data Analysis Plan**:Outline how you  will analyze the collected data to draw conclusions.

### Survey Development
Surveys are often based on **samples**. Sometimes in the analysis, the survey **data are weighted** so that the sample ends up better representing the *population* of interest. 

You **need** to know why, how the data were gathered, and these basic details in order to put your analytical work in the right context.

**Understanding Response Rates in Surveys**: A response rate is like a score that tells us how many people or groups participated in a survey compared to how many were invited.

*Example:* Imagine you throw a party and invite 100 friends, but only 30 show up. Your response rate would be 30%. This number helps us understand if the survey results are reliable. If only a few people respond, the results might not represent the whole group accurately.

**Why It Matters**: 
Knowing the response rate is important because it helps analysts see if there are any **biases** in the data. 

*For example:* If more women than men responded to a survey, the results might lean towards women's opinions. Analysts also need to check if the survey data needs to be adjusted, or "weighted," to ensure that all groups are fairly represented. This is like making sure that everyone at your party gets a say, not just the loudest voices.

### How can response rates affect survey data?
Response rates can significantly impact survey results in several ways:

1. **Representativeness**: A high response rate generally means that the survey results are more likely to reflect the views of the entire population. A low response rate can lead to results that are biased, as the opinions of those who did not respond may differ from those who did.
2. **Bias**: If certain groups (e.g., age, gender, location) are more likely to respond, the results may not accurately represent the entire population. For example, if younger people are more likely to respond, the survey may underrepresent older individuals' views.
3. **Data Quality**: Higher response rates can lead to more reliable data, as there is a larger sample size to analyze. This can improve the confidence in the findings.
Conversely, low response rates can raise questions about the validity of the data, making it harder to draw meaningful conclusions.
4. **Need for Weighting**: If certain groups are over- or under-represented in the responses, analysts may need to apply survey weights to adjust the data. This ensures that the analysis reflects the true population distribution.

Understanding these effects helps analysts interpret survey results more accurately and make informed decisions based on the data.

### What Analysts Need to Know in Understanding Survey Data

**Understanding The Data**
Each item of information in a survey is called a **variable**

A **codebook** is the roadmap for understanding the survey data:
1. Variable name, label, survey question number/wording
2. Type of variable: alpha, numeric, alphanumeric
    - Alpha: Only letters
    - Numeric: Only numbers
    - Alphanumeric: Both letters AND numbers
3. Variable response format/codes/labels
4. Includes codes for missing data (refusals, skips, etc.)

**Type of Numeric Variables**:
1. Nominal variables: 2 or more answers, no intrinsic order (no ranking)
    - Continous variable: A input number that represents an exact/actual amount
    - Ordinal variable: Implies ordering or ranking to the reponses (i.e., age range)
2. Ordinal variables: 2 or more answers with an order/rank (**most likely to get responses from survey respondents**)

**Likert Scale**: A type of ordinal variable used to measure attitudes/opinion in which responents rate their level of agreement with a statement.
